# SQL Challenge

<p>This is an exercise that contains 6 related CSV files  that will be used to perform required  SQL queries</p>

----

## Associated Files:
- 6 CSV files
- ERD document that outlines relationships
- SQL schemata file that shows table creation code
- SQL queries contained in one file
- Jupyter Notebook file that shows results in one output

---

**NB:** If I had a choice, I would not recommend placing all the files together in one folder.

It is messy to store all files together in one folder; **however**, this is per the requirements of the exercise.

For clarity's sake, I would have the two SQL files and the Jupyter Notebook in main.
CSV data files should be in its own folder--it's cleaner that way, and easier to read.
